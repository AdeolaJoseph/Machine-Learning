<!-- ## Introduction -->

üëã Hello! Welcome to my **Machine Learning Notebooks** repository! üìö This repository contains a collection of machine learning notebooks that I implemented during my master's program machine learning course. Each notebook represents a laboratory exercise that covers different machine learning techniques and algorithms. The notebooks are intended to serve as a personal reference and showcase my mastery of the course material. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced data scientist, these notebooks can be valuable resources to review and reinforce your understanding of machine learning concepts.

## Notebooks Overview

üìù Below is an overview of the laboratory exercises included in this repository:

**1. Decision Tree üå≥:**
   - This notebook implements a Decision Tree classifier from scratch using a popular dataset. It covers topics such as information gain, entropy, and tree pruning techniques to prevent overfitting.

**2. Linear Regression üìà:**
   - The Linear Regression notebook demonstrates how to perform simple linear regression and multiple linear regression using the least squares method. It also includes model evaluation techniques and interpretation of results.

**3. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) üìä:**
   - In this notebook, we explore Principal Component Analysis (PCA), a dimensionality reduction technique. It covers the mathematical concepts behind PCA and its application to reduce the feature space while preserving essential information.

**4. Supervised Classification using Hand-Crafted Features ‚úã:**
   - This notebook focuses on supervised classification using hand-crafted features. It demonstrates how to extract relevant features from the data and build a classifier to predict target labels.

**5. Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) üñºÔ∏è:**
   - The CNN notebook showcases image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks, a deep learning approach. It employs a popular dataset and TensorFlow/Keras to build and train the CNN model.

**6. Random Forest and XGBoost üå≥:**
   - This notebook explores ensemble methods such as Random Forest and XGBoost. It compares their performances on a dataset and explains the advantages of using ensemble techniques.

**7. Support Vector Machines (SVM) üéØ:**
   - In this notebook, we delve into Support Vector Machines (SVM), a powerful classification algorithm. It covers the theory behind SVM and its implementation using scikit-learn.

**8. Anomaly Detection ‚ö†Ô∏è:**
   - The Anomaly Detection notebook introduces various techniques to detect anomalies in data. It includes methods such as isolation forests and local outlier factor.

**9. Fully Connected Neural Network üß†:**
   - This notebook implements a Fully Connected Neural Network using Keras. It demonstrates how to build, train, and evaluate a neural network on a real-world dataset.
